This text file is to help people with UNIX systems compile DKBTrace.  The
raytracer was originally written for Amiga systems and was made portable to
IBM's and UNIX systems.  Due to the wide variety of UNIX systems, however,
it is difficult to make the code truly portable from system to system.

For a SUN 4, the instructions are as follows:
 
   1) cp unixconf.h config.h
   2) Edit config.h and comments the 3 lines:
      	//char *getenv PARAMS((char *name));
		//char *malloc PARAMS((int size));
		//void free PARAMS((void *));
   3) Take the unixmakefile supplied in this directory and rename
      it to Makefile.
   4) Change in the makefile the line
		cc $(LFLAGS) $(DKBOBJS) -lm
	By :
		${CC} $(LFLAGS) $(DKBOBJS) -lm
   4) Type "make"
 
Hopefully, everything will work.  The output file format is very similar to
QRT format except that the colours range from 0 to 255 instead of 0 to 127.
With the proper modifications, the Fuzzy Bit Map tools can display the
resulting images.
