As of July of 1990, there is a Ray-Trace specific BBS in the (708)
Area Code (Chicago suburbia) for all you Traceaholics out there.  The
phone number of this new BBS is (708) 358-5611.  Aaron Collins is
Co-Sysop of that board, and David Buck is a frequent caller.  There is now
also a Ray-Trace and Computer-Generated Art specific SIG on
