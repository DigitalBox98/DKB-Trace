\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

It seems that in any project like this, as soon as you fix some bugs,
some more appear.  I expect that the new features I provided in this
release will cause some problems somewhere.  There's only so much you
can do to get all the bugs out.  For the next little while, I intend
to keep the program stable feature-wise and just tackle major bugs.
Hopefully things will stablize this way (and I can take a much needed
breather).

Thanks go out to Alexander Enzmann\index{Enzmann, Alexander} for
generously providing the code
for the {\tt QUARTIC} surface algorithms, and for his assistance in
implementing it and for helping squash a couple of other bugs.

I would like to thank all the people who used versions 2.01 and 2.04
and provided useful comments and helpful suggestions.  The program has
been much improved with your help.

I would also like to thank my beta testers for all the help, bug
reports, suggestions, comments, and time spent.  I'd like to say a
special thank-you to Aaron Collins\index{Collins, Aaron} who has
fielded many of the
questions on the raytracer and has been invaluable in debugging,
testing, and generally improving the program.  Thanks guys.
