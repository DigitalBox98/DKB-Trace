DKBTrace has been made freely distributable.  The author retains the
copyright to the program but authorizes free distribution by BBS'es,

for the cost of the disk but must not sell the software for profit.
Non-profit organizations such as clubs may charge for the software so
long as the price is reasonable (less than \$5.00 more than the cost of
the disk) and so long as the buyers are informed that the program is
freely distributable.
