    The Color Editor is a tool for use by DKBTrace users to preview and
    design colors for inclusion in their data files. (It also gave me an
    opportunity to play around a bit during working hours while IBM was
    busy trying (unsucessfully) to recover our LAN server drives!)
    As you will see, I got a bit carried away with GUI interfaces during
    this project.  No, this is NOT an Amiga port.


    Environment / Commandline options:
    ----------------------------------
        TCE looks for your COLORS.DAT file in the current working directory
        unless you tell it to look elsewhere.
        There are two ways in which you can do this:

        1) You can set an evironment variable DKB to the path to COLORS.DAT
                SET DKB=C:\DKB\DATA\COLORS.DAT

                                    - or -

        2) You can tell TCE on the commandline:
                TCE c:\dkb\data\color.dat
                        - or -
                TCE mycolors.dat


    How it works:
    -------------
        1) Upon startup, the program will pause for a few seconds while it
           generates a gray palette and paints the preview image.

        2) If you didn't specify a color data file, and TCE can't find one
           in the current directory, it will ask you for the path and name
           of your color file.

        3) Viewing COLORS.DAT:
            Once the color file has been loaded, TCE will display the first
            color in your file.  You can scroll through the file with your
            up/down arrow keys.  Press "P" or "V" to project the color onto
            the preview image.

        4) Keys:

            R G or B (Upper Case)    Increase Red, Green, or Blue.
            r g or b (Lower Case)    Decrease Red, Green, or Blue.
            D or d                   Darken the current color.
            L or l                   Lighten the current color.
            C or c                   Clear all values to white,gray,or black.
            V,v,P,p                  PreView color on a shaded sphere.
            S,s,W or w               Save/Write the color to COLORS.DAT
            +                        Toggle Fast/Slow step rate.
            ESC                      Quit the program.
            F                        Specify Input/Output filenames.

    Editing/Creating Colors:
    ------------------------
    Existing COLORS.DAT color declarations will NEVER be over-written by TCE.
    You can, however, scroll to a color in the file and then modify it,
    and save it with a new name (or the same name, for that matter.  See
    section below about saving colors).


    Fine / Course Tuning:
    -----------------------
    On startup, changes are stepped by +/- 0.01, so you can make very fine
    changes in hue or saturation, but at the same time, it may seem sometimes
    like nothing is happening. Pressing the + key will toggle to a fast mode
    where changes are stepped +/- 0.1.  A panel in the lower right displays
    either "Fast" or "Slow" to show which mode you are currently using.


    Saving a color (S,s,W, or w keys)
    -----------------------
    Pressing the "S" or "W"  key puts you into save mode.  You will be prompted
    for a descriptive name for the new color.  Pressing <ENTER> without
    entering a name will abort the save operation and you will be returned
    to the color editor.

    Color names are NOT checked for duplicity, but at the same time,
    colors are never over-written.  If you do have duplicate color names,
    I believe DKB will use the last declared definition.  There is no delete
    function, so you will have to use a text editor to remove unwanted
    color declarations.  There is a limit to the number of DECLARATIONS that
    DKB can use, so you may wish to store new colors to a separate COLORS.DAT
    file until you want to use them.

    Spherical Preview  (V,v,P or p keys)
    -----------------
    This is, admittedly, a hack.  It's sorta slow generating the palette,
    and the way I draw the sphere leaves a bit to be desired, and it is
    only an approximation of the way the color will look on a rendered
    object, but it got the product out of the door and into your hands.
    (Besides, it's really kinda neat!).


    That's about it. Pretty easy, huh?  But I think you'll find it helpful
    when you're looking for that illusive color for bread dough!


    What's new:

    Version 1.01

        Doesn't really DO anything new, just what it does, it does better.

        Better palette scaling for the preview window.  Nicer preview
        image, too, with a sky and a shaded background.  Also, the
        preview image now is drawn only once, at load time.

        This gives two benefits:

        1) You only have to wait once for it to draw.
        2) Since the palette is not updated in the image until you
           press "Preview", you can compare a previously previewed color
           against one in the window.

        Now if only I can come up with a quicker palette loader!
        (I'm looking into it)

        The original release allowed you to specify a PATH to your
        color file, either on the command line or with a DOS environment
        variable "DKB".  Both methods still work, but must have the
        filename, too.  This is because DKB Version 2.10 looks for
        a file named COLORS.DAT, where earlier versions looked only
        for COLOR.DAT (singular).

        But wait... it gets better!
        You can now specify from within the program the name of your
        input file and optionally a name for a separate output file.
        What used to be the Help button (who needs help when you have
        a document file, right?) is now the "Files" button.  Press "F"
        and you will be asked if you wish to specify an Input file or
        an Output file.  Pressing <Enter> will abort the process.
