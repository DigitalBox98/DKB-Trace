                               by Steve Anger

  This program converts Atari CAD-3D .3D2 files into DKB files and produces
a more accurate and complete conversion than possible by using 3D22DKB and
DKB2DXF.  Light source locations, ambient light levels, and colour information
are converted properly.

Usage: 3D2-DKB inputfile [outputfile] [options]

inputfile  - Name of CAD-3D file (.3D2) assumed. 
outputfile - Name of DKB data file (.DAT) assumed.

options:   -d      - Display wireframe preview of object 
           -vxnnn  - x coordinate of VIEW_POINT location (default +50.0)
           -vynnn  - y    "       "      "         "     (default +50.0)
           -vznnn  - z    "       "      "         "     (default -50.0)

           -lxnnn  - x coordinate of LOOK_AT location (default 0.0)
           -lynnn  - y     "      "     "       "     (default 0.0)
           -lznnn  - z     "      "     "       "     (default 0.0)

  The object when rendered on DKB should have the same orientation and
magnification as the wireframe preview, however I havn't tested this
enough to be sure that it works.
