Dump2MTV								      Dump2MTV

NAME
	Dump2MTV

SYNOPSIS
	Dump2MTV <Dumpfile >MTVfile

DESCRIPTION
	Program converts Dump (or DKBTrace) dumpfiles to MTV ray-tracer (or
	RayShade) format.

	I made this converter because I wanted to use HamLab to convert my
	DKBTrace pictures to HAM and I didn't know how to make a HamLab
	filter. Later I made the Dump2hl filter and this program became quite
	useless for me but perhaps somebody can use this for some purposes.
