        DKBSHELL.C
            Minimal shell generator from Clifford Pickover.  This was the
            root of my BASIC version.  Clipped from Ray Tracing News.  See
            the comments at the top of file.
        DKBSHELL.BAS
            Source code.  Modify if you wish, but let me know of improvements,
            corrections, etc., please.
        DKBSHELL.EXE
            Compiled DKBSHELL.BAS.
        DKBSHELL.INC
            Include file for use with DKBSHELL.  Sets basic viewer position
            and a single light source.  You may want to add light sources,
            sky, etc.
        DKBSHELL.GIF
            Sample GIF image from DKB
        QRTSHELL.GIF
            Sample GIF image from QRT (another ray tracer).  I did this image
            with an early version of SHELLGEN.




DKBSHELL is a rather "quick & dirty" interface for DKB for generating scripts
for a particular type of ray-traced object: the Pickover Seashell.  The shell
is nothing more than a series of spheres arranged in a logarithmic spiral, but
designing the spiral without the aid of the computer would be almost impossible.
The default for the program is 600 spheres, each precisely arranged in X,Y,Z
and radius.  Try THAT with trial and error!

The DKBSHELL interface will show you APPROXIMATELY what you will get when you
run the DKB script.

IMPORTANT !! : Make your first runs using a "postage stamp" size image,
and set the -q command line switch to 0 until you're sure the image is
going to be centered and cropped properly.  If it is not, adjust the viewer
position until you have what you want.  (As a rule-of-thumb, the Z factor for
the viewer seems to work best at about 10 times the largest radius of the
generated spheres.)

The resulting script file is a test of Biblical proportions for your computer
and for DKB.  A 320x200 image with no texture or anti-aliasing can still take
DAYS on my 12mz AT (no math chip), so be forewarned.

Clifford Pickover's beautiful images can be seen in Scientific American,
July 1989 and in a 3 page feature in OMNI magazine, February 1990.

Pickover seems to use some surface texture and a gradient in his shells that
I have been unable to duplicate, although I think RIPPLES would suffice for
the texture.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE upload any nice images you produce, as well as any
improvements, enhancements, variations, etc. to DKBSHELL.  That is the
ONLY reason I have uploaded this package.  I'm selfish.  I want to see the
fruits of my labor.
