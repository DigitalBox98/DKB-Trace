NAME
        combinedump

SYNOPSIS
        combinedump [-l<lcol>] [-r<rcol>] [-c<compensations>] <lfile> <rfile>
                    <outputfile>

DESCRIPTION
        Combinedump combines two DKB/QRT dump format 24 bit picture files to
        one 3D stereopicture for red-green or red-blue 3D-glasses.

OPTIONS
        -l      Colour for left eye, '-lr', '-lg' or '-lb' for red, green or
                blue. Default is red.

        -r      Like '-l' but for right eye. Default is green.

        -c      Compensation values. If your monitor's red is visible
                trough your green glass. You can give a compensation value
                to be added to green colour if there is no red.

                There are 4 different compensation values, top left, top
                right, bottom left and bottom right. You can find out the
                right values by any painting program:

                Use a black background and draw a red and green box (if your
                3D-glasses are red-green ones). Now if you can see the red
                box trough the green glass, add some green colour to the
                background until the box is as invisible as possible.
                The amount of green colour added (in the scale of 0 to 255)
                is now the bottom right compensation. (if the green colour
                was on the right hand side in your glasses).

                Then if you can see the green box trough red glass, add red
                to the background to get the bottom left compensation.

                Now, change your background colour to yellow (full green and
                full red). If you can see the green box through the green
                glass, remove some green from background until green is
                invisible. The amount removed is now the top right
                compensation.

                You can get the top left compensation in a similiar way.

                To give the compensation values to program, add them after
                '-c' switch separated by 't', 'b', 'l' and 'r' characters.

                For example the default values can be given by following
                combination:

                -ctl34r0bl85r51

INPUTS
        Two pictures, one for left and one for right eye in DKBTrace's dump
        format. When creating pictures, use same object descriptions, but
        slightly different viewpoint.

OUTPUTS
        Combined picture created by gray-scaling input pictures and
        combining them with different colours. File is written to standard
        output, so it's better to redirect somewhere.
