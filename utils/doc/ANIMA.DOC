ANIM is a simple incrementer program to assist in creating DKB script files
for animation.  It reads in a data file containing an iteration count, a
rules section, and a skeleton code section.  As with much of the DKB utility
code that I have uploaded, this was written for my own use, not for use by
others, consequently, it does not have extensive error checking or fancy
parsing.  I make no apologies, just a warning to have patience and let me
know if something doesn't seem to work right.  If anyone wants to implement
this idea in C for portability, please feel free, just give me a little line
of credit as the originator.  I have my vanities.

The files that should be included in this ZIP package:
    ANIMA.EXE    The runtime version of the scriptor program.
    ANIMA.BAS    QuickBASIC source code.
    AMINA.INC    Include file for ANIMA.BAS.
    ANIMA.DOC    What you are reading now.
    ANIM1.DAT    A sample animation data file.
    ANIM2.DAT    Another sample data file.

    NOTE: The name of the animation data file should be only 4 or 5 characters
    long, since the output files are sequentially numbered, using the root
    of the data file as the root of the output (ie: ANIMA.DAT will create
    files ANIMA001.DAT ANIMA002.DAT, etc.)

Sample data file with comments:

ITERATIONS = 30             How many frames to create


Parameter #, starting value, step rate
( The $ is a token meaning "STEP" to the parser)
RULES:                      Defines rules for the Replaceable paramters
    %1 = -50 $ 4            Begin at -50 and increment by 4 for each iteration
    %2 = -50 $ -4           Begin at -50 and decrement by -1 for each iteration
    %3 = 255 $ -1           Begin at 255 and decrement by -1 for each iteration
    %4 = 1  $ 1
    %5 = 1 $ 5              Up to 9 replaceble parameters allowed

SKELETON:                   This is the template code for the animation.
