        [ TWISTER.COM ]

  The program TWISTER.COM will create a data file for the DKB raytracer 
describing an object that looks something like a twisted ribbon or a piece 
of macaroni. I used this program to create the floating macavirus in 
"Not a Trace of Reality" a.k.a Ntreal.gif. The 'twister' is a DKB UNION made 
up a many instances of a DECLAREd quadric. TWISTER.COM generates the 
complete code and a usable quadric, all the user needs to do is generate the 
'twister' dat file, INCLUDE it in a DKB scene file and place the 'twister' 
in their scene. TWISTED.DAT is an example of how to use the file generated 
by TWISTER.COM.

          [*INCLUDE WARNING!*]
  DKB Ver 2.04 and earlier can only correctly use one INCLUDE file. Because 
of the high number of objects needed to create a twister the code is best kept
in an INCLUDE file, but if you are using ver 2.04 or earlier you will need to
merge the twister file into your DKB dat file.



Parameters: [Default Values]

  File name: [twist.dat]
    This is the name of the file generated by TWISTER.COM

  Union Name: [Macaroni]
    Name of the 'twister' UNION to use in DECLARE statement.

  Quadric Name: [Part]
    Name of the DECLAREd quadric from which to build twister UNION.
    TWISTER.COM creates a sample quadric from the name you supply, but 
    any quadric may be used for the twister, just comment out the
    sample quadric and supply your own.

  Length of twister : [20.0]
    Version 1.00 of TWISTER.COM creates the object from the ground up.
    The quadrics in twister UNION will start at Y = 0.0 and end at
    Y = Length. The width is determined by the size of the quadric.

  Number of pieces : [50]
    The number of quadrics to use in building the twister.
    Low values make the twister blockier.
    Higher values will create a smoother shape.

  Number of twists : [1.0]
    How many complete twists the twister makes.
    Values below 1.0 create a more gentle curve.
    Higher values make the twister more corkscrew-ish.


        [ TWISTED.DAT ]  

  TWISTED.DAT is a simple DKB data file that demonstrates the use of the 
file TWIST.DAT. TWIST.DAT is generated by running TWISTER.COM with the default
values. On a IBM PC 386/20 & 387 coprocessor TWISTED.DAT renders in about
3 minutes at 80 X 60 with no anti-aliasing and about 2 hours at 320 X 240 
with default anti-aliasing.


        [ TWISTER.C ]

  TWISTER.C is the C language source code to TWISTER.COM. It should compile 
with any ANSI C compiler and I've tried to make it easily modifiable to create
more complex shapes. You are free to modify the code and distribute, but not to
extract payment for this code. Please comment your changes, use the update 
list in the source header comment and include this doc file.
