NAME
        catdump

SYNOPSIS
        catdump <inputfile-1> <inputfile-2> [<inputfile-3> ...] <outputfile>

DESCRIPTION
        This program concatenates several (possibly partial) DKB/QRT dump format
        picture files to standard output as one complete file. Pictures may
        overlap and they need not fill the whole picture.

        Priority of input files increases from left to right on command line,
        so if there are two overlapping pictures, the first file will be
        overlapped by the second one.

        If there are lines between two input files which are not covered by
        any input file, they will be filled with zero (black).

        If you want to replace some lines in the complete picture by
        a partial picture, put the complete picture file before partial one
        on command-line.

        If you want to concatenate two or more partial files, you will get
        the best results by placing files in reverse order on command line
        (first lower then upper).

OUTPUT 
        Concatenated DKB/QRT dump format file in standard output.
