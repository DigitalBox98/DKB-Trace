
         This program generates a DKB .DAT file containing a DECLAREd
    diamond based on user defined variables.  Actually, it draws a whole scene
    (light/view/floor, etc.). I got carried away. An outline of the diamond is
    displayed in graphics mode.

         To quote a buddy on user code modifications "You break it, you own
    both halves".  If you make any enhancements, please add your notes to
    this document (and please send a copy back to me via BBS).

                             This text drawing should be worth a few hundred.
