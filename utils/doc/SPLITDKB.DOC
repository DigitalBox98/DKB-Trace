SPLITDKB.EXE Version 1.0
By Dan Farmer March 10, '91

HISTORY:
    The concept for this program came from Randy Antler, who created a
    batchfile named PARTS.BAT to do the same job as this program does.
    The limitation I ran into, however, was that I was constantly re-editing
    copies of PARTS.BAT into 3PART.BAT and 4PART.BAT, and re-calculating the
    starting and ending lines for the various formats I wanted to render, etc.

    SPLITDKB yields the same results as PARTS.BAT, except that it allows
    you to custom tailor the resulting batch files easily.

HOW IT WORKS:
        SPLITDKB creates batch files.  It will create a batch file for
        each portion of the split, named PART1.BAT, PART2.BAT, etc.
        It also creates a batch file named GLUE.BAT that uses GLUETGA.EXE
        (came with your DKB stuff) to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again,
        and runs a processing batch file that you provide. (more on that later.)

COMMAND LINE:
        An input filename is mandatory.  Extension is optional, with .DAT
        assumed if none is specified.  You can also override the default
        switches by specifiying them FOLLOWING the input filename.

        The switches specified by default are: dkbno87 -p -a -v +d.
        These switches
           run the no87 version of dkb,
           do not pause when finished
           have no anti-aliasing
           suppress line numbers
           display the image during processing.

        NOTE: This is a simple program: ANY SWITCH ON THE COMMAND LINE
        WILL CAUSE THE PROGRAM TO DROP ALL DEFAULT SWITCHES, including
        the name of the DKB program to run!!  Your switch list MUST
        include the name of your DKB executeable! (Screen resolution
        is not considered a command line switch in this document.  The
        are provided by user input from within the program.)

        A convenient way to run SPLITDKB with a different set of switches
        would be with a batch file like the following:

        RUNSPLIT.BAT
            @echo off
            splitdkb %1 dkb [your list of preferred switches]


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
        There are two environment variables that can optionally be
        set before running (or by a batch file that runs SPLITDKB).

        The first is the path to the directory holding your input .DAT file.
        If your data file is not in the current directory (the one holding
        SPLITDKB), then you must SET DATA=data directory (SET DATA=C:\DKB\DATA)
        DO NOT INCLUDE A TRAILING BACKSLASH! (The program will put it in where
        its needed)

        The second is the path to the directory to put the output .TGA files.
        This is also where you need to keep the progam GLUETGA.EXE and
        a batch file named PROCESS.BAT that will do the image conversion.
        More about PROCESS.BAT later...
        So, to send the output to another directory, SET GLUE=glue directory.
        (SET GLUE=D:\GLUE)
        Again, DO NOT INCLUDE A TRAILING BACKSLASH! (The program will put it
        in where its needed)

PROCESS.BAT:
        Whether you chose to use a separate GLUE directory, or just dump
        everything into the current directory, you should have a batch file
        called PROCESS.BAT in the SAME DIRECTORY AS GLUETGA.EXE.  This batch
        file should accept one, and only one parameter: the root name of the
        original DKB data file.  It should call whatever program(s) you use
        to process the .TGA image into a .GIF image, whether that be PICLAB
        or TGA2IMG/IMG2GIF or whatever.  If you wish to skip this step, then
        before running any of the PARTn.BATs, edit GLUE.BAT to remove the
        call to PROCESS.BAT.
        Here is my own PROCESS.BAT using the TGA2IMG/IMG2GIF combination:

            @echo off
            :loop
                if "%1"=="" goto end
                tga2img %1
                img2gif -d -m %1
                del %1.img
                shift
                goto loop
            :end

CHANGES IN SPLITDKB SINCE INITIAL RELEASE TO BBS ( Mar 10, '91)
-------------------------------------------------
- Convert commandline switches to lower case.
- Re-calc default columns after row has been entered. (rows * 0.625)
- Put a beep at the end of GLUE.BAT to signal completion.
- The GLUE.BAT WAIT idea only works if using a separate GLUE directory.
  Otherwise, the .tga files DO exist, they just haven't been released yet.
- Limit splits to 9 or risk overflow on the PRINT USING's.
- If only 1 part, skip call to GLUETGA and simply rename it to ROOT$+".TGA"
- Delete PART?.TGA when finished.
- RUNSPLIT.BAT included.  First commandline parm is filename, rest are
  substituted.  RUNSPLIT filename %2 %3 %4, etc.
  An example would be: RUNSPLIT MYFILE -q0
- OOPS! Had rows & cols reversed in original code!
- Default # of parts is now 1.
- LZEXE the executeable for smaller size.
