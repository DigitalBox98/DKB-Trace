
	 This program generates a DKB .DAT file containing a DECLAREd
    gear based on user defined variables.  An outline of the gear is
    displayed in graphics mode.

	 To quote a buddy on user code modifications "You break it, you own
    both halves".  If you make any enhancements, please add your notes to
    this document (and please send a copy back to me via BBS).

		    Enclosed are the following files:
		      GEAR.BAS	      QuickBASIC source
		      GEAR.EXE	      MS-DOS executable
		      GEAR.DOC	      This file
		      GEARSAMP.DAT    Sample gear scene


Tooth type (Pointed/Flat)      :    Currently only supports P.

Wheel type (Disk/Spokes)       :    Can be either flat disk with holes carved
				    out or spokes.

Number of teeth 	       :    What it says.

Gear Radius	    from center:    Radius to midpoint of tooth. This makes
				    it easy to measure center points of
				    MESHED gears (why would you only have 1?).

Disk/Spoke Thicknes from center:    Usually thinner here than in hardened
				    teeth & hub.

Tooth Height		       :    Hieght of tooth itself.

Tooth&Hub Thickness from center:    Usually thicker than its support.

Axel Radius	    from center:    "How big is the hole used to mount it?"

Hole/Spoke Multiple	       :    Number of teeth per hole-carved-out-of-disk
				    or per spoke. Note: Lower numbers = more
				    holes/spokes, but fewer frames needed for
				    rotation.


	 Applications notes:  The gear is designed with the origin in
     its center.  What more can I say?
